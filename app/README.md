# App Assigment

We will evaluate you on the following parameters:

* Ability to write code that is clean, readable and easy to maintain.
* Ability to organise your code in a good project structure.
* Knowledge of the framework or library used, and good utilization of best practices.

The emphasis for us is not to see a complete solution but to see your approach. So focus on staying within the maximum of 2 to 2.5 hours instead of aiming to complete all tasks below.

## Tasks

### 1. Create your application
The application is an interface for a music collection, where a user can get an easy overview of albums, and add/edit albums in the collection.

Setup a boilerplate app and feed it the data from the sample JSON.

### 2. Add music
As a user you want to be able to add new entries to the collection and fill out information for the entry. A music entry can consist of - but is not limited to - the following data:

* Artist name
* Album name
* Genre(s)
* Album cover
* Year of release
* Spotify link for the album

### 3. View the music collection
As a user you want a nice overview of your music collection. Create a page where the user can browse the music, this can be a list, a grid or any third way. You are free to choose any css library to style it.

### 4. Edit your music collection
Anyone can make a mistake, so sometimes it is nice to be able to edit entries. Allow the user to edit the information for a music entry and save the information.

## After the assignment
Consider these questions for the assignment evaluation.

* What do you consider the strengths and weaknesses of using a router in a simple app such as this?
* What are the benefits of using a state management system?
* Can you differentiate or classify components by their role in the app?
* How does the framework or library used to solve this assignment compare to other popular Javascript libraries and frameworks, and what do you consider advantages and disadvantages of the one used?
